Inferno, A Lush Theme for Neovim.
===

See: http://git.io/lush.nvim for more information on Lush and a helper script
to setup your repo clone.

Made this fiery red theme with Lush. Many thanks to Lush for the theme building tool.

In your Neovim configuration directory, you can load it with Lazy:
`return{
  "for-lack-of-a-better-name-j/inferno.nvim"
}`
